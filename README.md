Budgeter is an expenses tracker and budget planner.  It helps you keep on top
of spending with the goals of eliminating debt and increasing savings.

It's based on the opinion that financial responsibility comes out of habit and
a mindset, so the software encourages certain habits. These are described below.

### Awareness of spending

It's increasingly easy to spend money and harder to monitor where it's going.
Financially responsible people are aware of how much they spend each month.

Budgeter requires you to enter all transactions manually, by design.

### Choosing how to allocate your income.

How do you know how much to budget for in each category? It's pointless trying
to do this up front. When you first user Budgeter you just record transactions.

Once you have some data you can pick categories yourself and how much to
allocate in each of them.

Budgeter offers suggestions on how to group your expenditure, and lets you
determine a budget which works for your finances.

### Make educated spending decisions.

Stop checking your account balance when deciding if you can afford something.
Instead check what you have left for that spending category.

Pick a category and Budgeter will tell you how much you have left.  We also
show whether you are projected to meet your spending goal for this month.

The goal isn't to save as much money as possible and feel bad about spending
money, but to stick to your chosen limits.

### Plan for infrequent expenditure

Your emergency fund should be for real emergencies.  Predictable spending like
travel, annual bills and insurance can be broken down into smaller monthly amounts.

Enter a future expenditure and Budgeter will allocate money to raise funds for
it in advance.

### "A part of all you earn is yours to keep"

Saving is a first-class citizen in Budgeter. By default, 10% of your total
income is marked for saving.

When you're getting started, this will first be used to pay off debt and to
build an emergency fund.

Within a few months, you can save it how you wish.
